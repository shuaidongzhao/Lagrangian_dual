=======
The model shows a Lagrangian relaxation for a location-transportation problem. 
The original MIP is decomposed into two problems in order to deduce a multiplier 
for a particular constraint based on Lagrange relaxation. 

The main aim is to show multiple optimization through modifications of different models 
existing in a single environment. 
 
This file contains two implementation using OPL and C++ Concert. 

For consistency, this is built using an equivalent AMPL model at:
